Attempt to make standalone flash programming tool for P&E USB BDM Multilink Cable to use with Freescale MCUs.

To make this shit work, you need to steal somewhere this pack of proprietary blobs and put them to lib directory
989ce94e9621843ae5fc947cafa5d075  libborunwind.so.6.0
27d737101c07174d0829fd372af88578  libUnit_cfz.so
6ca9ef28008e2d24ae2df0fc8e79bc97  libwdapi1002.so
c20d30efcfbca50f312e8d0ec7f70702  peosbdmv1.so
27d737101c07174d0829fd372af88578  unit_cfz_v1.so

some can be stolen from pemicro windrvr drivers, some others - from freescale codewarrior
